        1.) Kay always thought this day would end up being the worst day of her life. Her mother
        finally kicked her out of their trailer, this time for good, after getting into a heated
        fight with one of her drunk boyfriends.

        2.) That is why she was hitchhiking along the interstate that afternoon, praying to God that
        someone would stop before it got dark. She had no idea where she wanted to go, just that she
        needed to get far away from the life she was leaving behind. Just when she was beginning to
        think no one would stop for her, an old Jeep slowed to a stop just a few yards ahead of her.

        3.) "Sweetie, what is a girl like you doing hitchhiking out in the middle of nowhere?" said
        a middle aged woman seated in the passenger seat of the Jeep. She was in such a hurry to get
        out of there that she hardly had time to grab any of her things. All she had in the world
        were the clothes on her back and a backpack full of underwear, t-shirts, and make-up.
