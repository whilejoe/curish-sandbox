      <h1>How She Made Me Feel</h1>
      <p>
        Kay always thought this day would end up being the worst day of her life. Her mother finally
        kicked her out of their trailer, this time for good, after getting into a heated fight with
        one of her drunk boyfriends. She was in such a hurry to get out of there that she hardly had
        time to grab any of her things. All she had in the world were the clothes on her back and a
        backpack full of underwear, t-shirts, and make-up. She had almost no money either, just a
        few crumpled one dollar bills in the back pocket of her jean shorts.

        That is why she was hitchhiking along the interstate that afternoon, praying to God that
        someone would stop before it got dark. She had no idea where she wanted to go, just that she
        needed to get far away from the life she was leaving behind. Just when she was beginning to
        think no one would stop for her, an old Jeep slowed to a stop just a few yards ahead of her.
        Thinking it could take off at any moment, Kay ran toward it with her tired legs.

        "Sweetie, what is a girl like you doing hitchhiking out in the middle of nowhere?" said a
        middle aged woman seated in the passenger seat of the Jeep.
